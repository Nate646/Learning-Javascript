# Learning-Javascript

This repository contains code for JavaScript problems I find interesting and challenging. Most, but not all of the problems are from Hack Reactor's Free Bootcamp Prep program. I'm trying to master the basics of JS syntax by exposing myself to as many problems as possible.

**Edit:** *Not learning JS anymore. I haven't gotten around to upoading the Hack Reactor problems.*
